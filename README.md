A little notes to help me remember stuff:

1. ```app``` contains the source code for a fast blinking LED using MCUBoot
2. ```app-2``` contains the source code for a slow blinking LED using MCUBoot
3. ```app-wifi-update``` contains the source code to update firmware over wifi. It follows the tutorial on the Zephyr site. There's a few config options that need to be changed if you want to use it.
4. ```app-bootloader``` contains some config used for MCUBootloader. It was used for ```app``` and ```app-2```.
